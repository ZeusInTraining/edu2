Model description       : Neo from the matrix. The first model I have tried to create. 
			  I have been using 3DStudio for awhile now so I decided to try 
			  something different. Next model I create I will not make the 
			  clothing so bulky. It kind of made the arms go into the model.
			  I added a little spice to it and made the coat animated.
