Model description       : Anthony Jun Hung Ng (Author himself) model for Quake III Arena. 

Other info              : This version of Anthony has now been updated so that practically EVERYTHING is original. Other than a few grunts and groans from Quake 3 itself, no more borrowed sounds from other games. The voices are dubbed by Anthony Ng himself. This is version 1.0 of Anthony. This is the first model I have ever built, and I am pretty pleased with the results. Hope you'll like it too. I will come out with later versions including as a "Mechanthony" cyborg version as soon as I learn to use shaders properly.

Thanks to               : Zer0-L0giC and Vagabond for answering my questions on ICQ. Thanks to "Spaniel" Benn Moss for his tutorials at machinima.com and for trying to help me through e-mail. Thanks to the creator of Milkshape 3D, without which this model would never have been made.

Authors Notes: I have put bot support for ALL the skins, so if you want to play against him in "free for all" mode, you can choose any of them to fihgt against. This means, however, that in the any red vs. blue team based game that the "red" or "blue" version will show up no matter which bot you choose, although the funname/name will still be different.
