Base info               : This is my first model.  I basically followed Paul Steed's book to create the mesh.  
			  In some areas, especially the arms, you might see similarities.  
			  Um, buy the book, it's excellent: "Modelling a Character in 3DS Max".
			  Thanks to Polycount for all the help getting it into the proper format.
			
			


Software used           : 3ds max R4, Character Studio 3, Photoshop 6, pop_n_fresh's Max to MD3 Exporter, 
			  NPherno's md3 Compiler, Mastaba SeeMD3.

Known Bugs              : Not really a bug, but I didn't really do a good job of using symmetry to save texture space.

Build/Animation time    : Honestly, about 3 months on and off, trying to learn all this stuff thoroughly.
			  Hoping to add a custom weapon and some more skins soon.
