Info:

I made the Lia Fail skin for my wife Kirsten's Birthday.
Lia Fail is a nickname I gave her in October '98 when I initially met her online.
It means 'The Navel of the Goddess' and I thought it was an apt nickname for her
as that is the way I see her :)
I also made the LiaFail skin to try some more purist shading techniques again.

The CTF skins are more inkeeping with the Tankgirl model style.
Thanks to Wraith for the Cool model.
Thanks to Kirsten for allowing me to borrow her face.

Enjoy the skins

3.21.2000   Quake 3 Arena Skin & SoundPak for Tankgirl

Accessory's description	: This is a skin and a soundpak for the kickass Tank Girl player model from Wrath. 
			  The name "Tanicha" is taken from one issue where Tank Girl is told a story of herself as a vengful Austrailian spirit that wastes a bunch of scumbags trying to oppress the Aboriginal peoples! 
			  I have always loved Tank Girl (even the movie was pretty good).  But I was a little disappointed when there wasn't a comic style model in the pak.  Even more disturbing was the fact that she sounded like Sarge!  I am very pleased with the results of this skin and welcome any feedback anyone feels is necessary. This is my third Quake skin ever.  I spent hours and hours on this model, so I hope everyone likes it as much as I do.

Other info              : Tank Girl comics are WAY beetter than the movie. 
			  One Case in point - in the film, why the HELL doesn't anyone call her Tank Girl? They all call her "Rebecca."  That was pretty damn gay.

Accessory's description	: This is my first Q3 skin done from scratch

"TINTIN" skin for Wrath's "tank Girl" PPM
by Matthew "M@tthi@§" Mella

Didn't really have time to tidy up the .tgas, so the actual files look a bit messy, but the
skin's not too bad.  Not perfect, but Wrath needed some skins, so I thought I'd get this 
one done ASAP.

A personal vision really... fishnet... goths... someone mentioned Punkchick on the Polycount 
UBB , and I like to please.  Not too strictly TG, but then not too far off.

Everythings from scratch, it's my first released Q3 skin (if it gets released :( ).  

Can't wait to see the model on the streets!

BTW TinTin... geddit?  The bra?  Nevermind... <updated May 8, 2000>

			See http://www.worthing.co.uk/tank.htm for a more thorough history of the character, or do your own
			net search for "Tank Girl" and see what comes up.

Other info:		Gutboy has done some bot files...but I haven't had a chance to sort through them and make sure they all work yet,
			so as soon as I get a chance to do that, I'll release them as well.  They seem a bit sparse on dialogue,
			if any die hard Tank Girl fans would be interested in scripting some bot chat, I'd be more than happy
			to tell them what we need and put together a nice bot file for this model.

Thanks to:		Gutboy, Psychodroid, & Matthew "M@tthi@§" Mella, and Kevin 'Rorshach' Johnstone for doing skins.
			NPherno for being such a great lay and being so good with tools.
			NPherno's mom...for pretty much the same reasons.

Author(s) notes:	This model was built, mapped, and animated in about a week.  I put the model up on my
			site and posted a message at www.polycount.com asking for intersted parties to do skins
			for her.

			After about a month, I still hadn't gotten anything back.  Gutboy came forward and volunteered to
			skin her, and he sent me a finished skin less than a week later.
			Since then, there have been a couple of skins that managed to leak in at the last second...both
			of which are top notch efforts and happily addeded to the default flavor.

			I'm still hoping that this model might fulfill my life long fantasy of releasing a player model
			that gets 2 bajillion skins done for it by the community. ;)
